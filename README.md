Finger vein recognition has captured increasing attention due to its high security. However, the collected finger vein images are always degraded dramatically on account of light scattering in human skin tissue during near-infrared light transmission imaging. This certainly leads to unreliability of finger vein features and low accuracy of finger vein recognition. The traditional methods of finger vein image scattering removal cannot output clear finger vein images end-to-end, and the processes of restoring degraded finger vein images are laborious. Therefore, with the aim at improving the visibility of finger vein feature and generating clear finger vein images end-to-end, a simple but effective method utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. First, a muti-scale CNN named E-Net is built to acquire credible estimation map of finger vein images, which is conducive to obtain pleasurable restoration outcome. Then, based on improved biological optical model, an end-to-end scattering removal network is designed, called Finger Vein Image Scattering Removal Network (FVSR-Net). Such a novel CNN design facilitates the generation of clearer venous regions. Experiments accomplished on two finger vein Datasets attest that our proposed method is superior in terms of visual quality and recognition performance.
